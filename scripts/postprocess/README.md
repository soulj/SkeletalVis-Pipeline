R scripts to summarise the galaxy outputs.

* postGalaxyProcess.R takes the differential expression files from the pipeline to calculate a summary differential expression table and pairwise expression response similarity
* tsne.R generates a tsne plot based on a similarity matrix of expression signatures and highlights clusters.
* validation.R produces summary plots and validation plots of the expression similarity
