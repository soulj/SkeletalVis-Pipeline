\title{Create interactome from STRING database}

\description{
   
     This function is used to retrieve protein-protein interactions from STRING and create an interactome. 
     The input data is a protein-protein interaction file downloaded from STRING, in the following format:

::

     10090.ENSMUSP00000000001	10090.ENSMUSP00000000153	binding		0	540
     10090.ENSMUSP00000000001	10090.ENSMUSP00000000369	activation	activation	1	229
     10090.ENSMUSP00000000001	10090.ENSMUSP00000000574	activation	activation	0	800
     10090.ENSMUSP00000000001	10090.ENSMUSP00000000631	reaction	1	900  
     
     The first and second columns are two proteins, identified by their STRING id.
     The third column shows the mode of interaction. The fourth column shows the nature of interaction.
     The fifth column shows the direction of interaction, where 0 means the interaction is from node B to node A, and 1 means the interaction is from node A to node B.
     The sixth column shows the confidence score on a scale from 0 to 1000, where 1000 is the highest confidence. Confidence scores are divided by 1000 to get a score between 0 and 1.
     
     The input aliases data is a dictionary created manually by sending lists of STRING ids into STRING and retrieving the "networks protein description" files from their website.
     All mouse proteins listed in the "10090.protein.aliases.v10.txt" file were converted in that way, and the results were concatenated into a single file named "STRINGv10.txt". The format of dictionary should be:

::

     GNAI3	10090.ENSMUSP00000000001	
     A3R	10090.ENSMUSP00000000574	
     GRM6	10090.ENSMUSP00000000631	
     
     The usual threshold used for high confidence scores is 0.7. Interactions whose confidence score are below the confidence threashold are deleted.

     The output of the above example should be:

::

        A3R  GNAI3
        GNAI3  GRM6
        
     The output is in the same format as the output of the createConsensusDBInteractome function.
