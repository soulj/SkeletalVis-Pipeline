\title{Create interactome from consensus DB database}

\description{
   
  This function is to retrieve protein-protein interactions from ConsensusDB.
  The input data is a protein-protein interaction file downloaded from ConsensusPathDB. http://string-db.org/newstring_cgi/show_download_page.pl
  Interactions in the input data may be of 3 different types as shown below:
 
:: 
 
  BIND	14988405	5HT2C_MOUSE,DLG3_MOUSE	0.0149385
  BIND	15603741	ALEX_MOUSE.GNAS1_MOUSE.GNAS2_MOUSE.GNAS3_MOUSE,ZDHC3_MOUSE	NA
  BIND	12614612	ORC5_MOUSE	0.0089412599999999995
  
  When the participant node (ALEX_MOUSE.GNAS1_MOUSE.GNAS2_MOUSE.GNAS3_MOUSE) is a complex formed by several proteins, 
  then the confidence score is "NA" and the interaction is deleted.
  Interactions with only one node to represent selfregulation are extended to an interaction between two identical nodes.
  The names of participant nodes should be formated in the same way as the gene names from STRING by removing the end component, for example "_MOUSE".
  The expected output of the above three recordes should be:

::

  5HT2C  DLG3
  ORC5   ORC5
  
 The output is in the same format as the createSTRINGInteractome function,
  which is 2 columns of gene names.
