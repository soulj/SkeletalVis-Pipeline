Directory of test R scripts used as a test harness/evironment for developing the R scripts that are deployed to the [Sybil Galaxy instance](https://secure.sybil-fp7.eu/galaxy/).

The scripts depend on having RGalaxy installed and the install_RGalaxy.R in the install directory can do this for you.

An example of running a test script is:

```
R --no-save < test_filterForPresentProbes.R
```
